terminal and don't want to break workflow to
maintain Jira.

# Quick start

This section show how to perform some of the most common Jira
operations.

### Commenting

Let's start and see how to comment an issue.
Here is the syntax:

```
jiraline comment -m "Message text" <issue_name>
```

For example:

```
jiraline comment -m "This is comment made from my terminal" JL-42
```


### Assigning issues

Next step will be assigning an issue to user:

```
jiraline assign -u <user_name> <issue_name>
```


### Transitions

Displaying transitions available for an issue:

```
jiraline issue transition <issue_name>
```

Transitioning an issue to a new state:

```
jiraline issue transition --to <transition_id> <issue_name>
```


### Displaying issues

```
jiraline issue show <issue_name>
```

**Shortcut**

If only basic information is needed, a shortcut may be used:

```
jiraline issue <issue_name>
```

#### Displaying detailed fields

To access nested fields in Jira responses use dot-separated keys parts:

```
~]$ jiraline issue show -f assigne JL-42
assignee = John Doe <email@example.com>
~]$ jiraline issue show -f assigne.emailAddress JL-42
assignee.emailAddress = email@example.com
```


### Built-in help screens

To display built-in help screens use `help` command (help screens are automatically
generated by CLAP library):

```
jiraline help [--verbose]
```

The `--verbose` option forces recursive help screen builting; use it to get one, big
help screen browsable with `less`.


#### Detailed help screens

To get detailed help on a subcommand use:

```
jiraline help -v <subcommand>...
```

For example, to get help on transitions:

```
jiraline help -v issue transition
```

To get help on an option use:

```
jiraline help -v <subcommand>... <option>
```

For example, to get help on transitions:

```
jiraline help -v issue transition --to
```

# Settings

In file `~/.jiraline` put the following contents:


```
{
    "domain": <your JIRA cloud domain>,
    "credentials": {
        "user": <your user name>,
        "password": <your password>
     }
}
```

Sample valid config that will let you connect to `example.atlassian.net`:

```
{
    "domain": "example",
    "credentials": {

        "password": "$ecretP4s$w0rd1"
     }
