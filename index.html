<h1>Goals and mission</h1>
<p>
  Our mission is to make work with Jira more fluent. We are developers and do that for developers. We don`t want to switch beetween browser and our natural environment which is terminal. We do almost everything from command line, and we feel good with that.
</p>
<p>
Goals are pretty straigth - implement all functionality provides by Jira API. 
</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
What can you do from command line:
<ul>
<li>comment</li>
<li>assign</li>
<li>list transitions</li>
<li>do transistions</li>
</ul>
